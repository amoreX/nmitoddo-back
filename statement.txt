Manufacturing - From Order to Output, All in One Flow
Problem Statement
Develop a modular manufacturing management application that enables businesses to
create, track, and manage their end-to-end production process digitally.The platform
aims to replace fragmented spreadsheets and manual tracking with a centralized,
user-friendly platform.
Key Challenges in Existing Manufacturing Process:
1. Fragmented systems for manufacturing orders, stock management, and BOM
(Bill of Materials).
2. Lack of visibility into production stages and work order progress.
3. No dynamic filtering/dashboard to quickly see order status.
4. Limited integration between stock, production, and reporting.
5. Manual paperwork for BOMs, stock ledgers, and reports → prone to errors.
Target Users
1. Manufacturing Managers – oversee production orders and workflows.
2. Operators / Shop-floor Workers – execute assigned work orders and update
status.
3. Inventory Managers – track stock movement, raw material usage, and ledger
balance.
4. Business Owners / Admins – monitor overall production KPIs, generate reports,
and ensure traceability.
Use Case Scenarios
1. Authentication & Access
○ User signs up/logs in.
○ Redirected to Manufacturing App Dashboard.
2. Dashboard & Filtering
○ The landing page lists all manufacturing orders.
○ Dynamic dashboard filter → by order state (Planned, In Progress, Done,
Canceled).
3. Navigation via Master Menu (Right Sidebar)
○ Manufacturing Orders: Create and track production orders.(same app
dashboard)
○ Work Orders: Assign and manage work steps for operators.
○ Work Centers: Manage machines/locations capacity, downtime, and
utilization.
○ Stock Ledger: Track material movement and inventory balance.
○ Bills of Material (BOM): Define material requirements per finished good.
4. Profile & Setup (Left Sidebar)
○ Click avatar → side profile menu opens.
○ Options: My Profile, My Reports.
Authentication
● Common Login/Signup Page for all users.
● OTP verification for forgot password.

● Bill of Materials (BoM): Recipe of raw materials and operations needed to make a
product.
● Manufacturing Order (MO): A process form to manufacture a product of a defined
quantity.
● Work Orders (WO):Operations/ Jobs required to manufacture a product
● Work Centers: Machines/ Workshop where manufacturing operations take place.
● Stock Ledger/ Product Master : Create products and maintain stock availability.
Understanding Bill of Materials (BoM)
● A BoM defines how a product is built.
● It lists components (raw materials) required to make a finished product.
Example:
Product: Wooden Table – Quantity –1 Unit
BoM Recipe
Components Operations
4 × Wooden Legs Assembly -60 mmins
1 × Wooden Top Painting -30 mins
12 × Screws Packing -20 mins
1 × Varnish Bottle
When an MO is created for 1 Wooden Table, It should automatically populate the recipe and
adjust the recipe based on MO quantity to be produced.
Manufacturing Order (MO)
● Once you have a requirement for a Wooden Table, create a Manufacturing Order (MO)to
manufacture it.
● The MO should contain:
○ Finished Product (what to produce).
○ Quantity to produce.
○ Schedule Start Date
○ Assignee
○ Raw Materials (auto-fetched from BoM).
Work Order/Operations
● A Work Order (WO) is a step in the manufacturing process.
● When you confirm a Manufacturing Order (MO), it allows you to work on operations with
a start/pause button.
Example: To produce a Wooden Table:
Assembly @ Assembly LIne for 60 mins
Painting @ Paint Floor for 30 mins
Packing @ Packaging Line for 20 mins
Each of these steps is a Work Order under the same MO.
Work Center
● A Work Center is a physical location, machine, or team where a Work Order is executed.
Example:
● Assembly Line → Work Center for Assembly step.
● Paint Floor → Work Center for Painting
● Packaging Line → Work Center for Packaging.
Production of Finished Goods
● After consumption, the system adds finished goods to stock.
● This increases the inventory of the final product (tables, chairs, etc.).
Stock Ledger / Product Master
● The Stock Ledger records every material movement in the system.
Example (from file flow): When making 10 Units Wooden Tables:
Wha Stu t Ne d to Un e s d
● MO is the big container → Holds everything.
● WO are sub-steps → Break MO into tasks.
● Work Centers are resources → Where the tasks are executed.
● Stock Ledger is the evidence → Tracks every material in & out and show available
stock
● Stock Out (Consumption)
Negative Product Movement
Legs: - 40 Units
Tops: -10 Units
Screws: -120 Units
Varnish: -10 Bottles
● Stock In (Production)
Positive Product Movement
Tables: +10 Units
